Trends Looking Positive
• Summary: 1Q results were above plan, with a return to positive comps. Oil-affected
regions continue to get better and also turned positive in the qtr (incl both TX and
ND/WY/CO regions). The company is still experiencing some issues with its Ecom
business but even these problems seemed to have improved vs last qtr. Mgmt did
not raise its annual guidance because it’s still early in the year, but if trends continue
in the direction they have been going, that may prove conservative.
• The qtr: EPS of $0.03 vs our est of $0.01, cons of $0.00 and guidance of $0.00.
Sales +4.5%, comps +1.3% (vs cons +0.0%), op margin +20bps, with GM -80bps
and SG&A leverage of 100bps. Inv/store -4% (vs comps +1.3% in 1Q).
• Guidance: Reiterated F18 guidance of $0.52-0.57 vs cons of $0.56. Guided 2Q
EPS to $0.02 vs cons of $0.02 based on comps similar to 1Q.
• The good: (1) Have seen sequential improvement in store comps QTD (even
excluding shift of promo into Jul TY from Aug LY), (2) Seeing improvement in oilaffected
markets. TX comps + mid single digits and ND, CO and WY + low single
digits after both regions were down mid single digits in 4Q, (3) Will introduce new
women’s line with country music star Miranda Lambert in the Fall of 2018, (4) Ecom
business has sequentially improved vs 1Q (1Q Ecom sales overall were flat vs LY),
and (5) Launching private label credit card chainwide later this month.

Our estimates and TP: There are no changes to our F18E of $0.56. We model
comps +1% for the year and operating margin of 6.1% (down 10bps). We are
raising our F19E from $0.63 to $0.67 to reflect slightly higher comps than previously
forecast (+1.5% vs +1% prev). We are raising our TP from $9 to $10 to reflect our
forecast increase.

Boot Barn
Company description
Boot Barn is the largest retail chain selling western and work-related footwear,
apparel and accessories in the U.S operating ~170 stores. Stores are generally offmall
and feature national western and workwear brands such as Ariat, Wrangler,
Justin, Carrhartt and Wolverine as well as a smaller, but growing, assortment of
private label merchandise (~10% of the mix in 2015). In June 2015, the company
acquired competitor Sheplers, which operated ~25 stores and an ecommerce
website.
Investment strategy
We rate shares of Boot Barn Buy (1). We like the stock given its "red state"
customer base, purely domestic exposure, and high short interest, in addition to it
being a niche retail concept that has good square footage growth potential. With
stabilizing rig count and the company beginning to see some improvement in oil/gas
markets, we believe comps should begin to improve in the coming quarters.
Valuation
Our DCF-based target price (based on a 9% discount rate and 6.5x terminal
multiple) is $10. It represents an implied multiple of ~8x our 2018E EBITDA slightly
above the sofltines group median given BOOT's higher square footage growth
potential.
Risks
Prepared for Rong Lu (research email)
Appendix A-1
Analyst Certification
Risks to our target price include: (1) That the price of oil begins to decline again,
further hurting oil sensitive markets, (2) That Sheplers results deteriorate and/or the
integration encounters difficulties, (3) That the women's apparel business gets
worse, (4) That expansion into new markets is not successful. If the impact on the
company from any of these factors proves to be greater than we anticipate, the
stock will likely have difficulty achieving our target price and (5) That the company is
unable to fix its Ecom systems issues..

and seeks to do business with companies and/or trades on securities covered in this research reports. As a result, investors should be aware that the Firm
may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of this report.
Analysts’ compensation is determined by Citi Research management and Citigroup’s senior management and is based upon activities and services intended
to benefit the investor clients of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates (the “Firm”). Compensation is not linked to specific transactions or

institutional clients and the management teams of covered companies. Typically, company management is more likely to participate when the analyst has a
positive view of the company.

Guide to Citi Research Fundamental Research Investment Ratings:
Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks.
Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned.
Investment Ratings: Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return
("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The
Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not
assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment
catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and,
thus, not derive an ETR. Analysts may place covered stocks "Under Review" in response to exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the

analyst's thesis) affecting the company and / or trading in the company's securities (e.g. trading suspension). As soon as practically possible, the analyst will
publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Under Review and Neutral to Hold in our
ratings distribution table for our 12-month fundamental rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider Under Review to be a recommendation.
Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change
in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At other times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price
movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations from specified ranges will be permitted but will become subject to
review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made
only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.
Prior to May 1, 2014 Citi Research may have also assigned a three-month relative call (or rating) to a stock to highlight expected out-performance (most
preferred) or under-performance (least preferred) versus the geographic and industry sector over a 3 month period. The relative call may have highlighted a
specific near-term catalyst or event impacting the company or the market that was anticipated to have a short-term price impact on the equity securities of
the company. Absent any specific catalyst the analyst(s) may have indicated the most and least preferred stocks in the universe of stocks under
consideration, explaining the basis for this short-term view. This three-month view may have been different from and did not affect a stock's fundamental
equity rating, which reflected a longer-term total absolute return expectation.
Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside calls:
Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch Upside or Downside call to highlight specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the
market that are expected to influence the share price over a specified period of 30 or 90 days. A Catalyst Watch Upside (Downside) call indicates that the
analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over the specified period. A Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at
the end of the specified 30/90 day period; the analyst may also close a Catalyst Watch call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research
note. A Catalyst Watch Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock’s fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term
total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch Upside call corresponds to a buy
recommendation and a Catalyst Watch Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside or Catalyst

Citi Research generally disseminates its research to the Firm’s global institutional and retail clients via both proprietary (e.g., Citi Velocity and Citi Personal
Wealth Management) and non-proprietary electronic distribution platforms. Certain research may be disseminated only via the Firm’s proprietary distribution
platforms; however such research will not contain changes to earnings forecasts, target price, investment or risk rating or investment thesis or be otherwise
inconsistent with the author’s previously published research. Certain research is made available only to institutional investors to satisfy regulatory
requirements. Individual Citi Research analysts may also opt to circulate published research to one or more clients by email; such email distribution is
discretionary and is done only after the research has been disseminated. The level and types of services provided by Citi Research analysts to clients may
vary depending on various factors such as the client’s individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communications from analysts, the

client’s risk profile and investment focus and perspective (e.g. market-wide, sector specific, long term, short-term etc.), the size and scope of the overall
client relationship with the Firm and legal and regulatory constraints.
Pursuant to Comissão de Valores Mobiliários Rule 483, Citi is required to disclose whether a Citi related company or business has a commercial relationship
with the subject company. Considering that Citi operates multiple businesses in more than 100 countries around the world, it is likely that Citi has a
commercial relationship with the subject company.
Securities recommended, offered, or sold by the Firm: (i) are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; (ii) are not deposits or other
obligations of any insured depository institution (including Citibank); and (iii) are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of the principal
amount invested. The Product is for informational purposes only and is not intended as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of a security. Any
decision to purchase securities mentioned in the Product must take into account existing public information on such security or any registered prospectus.
Although information has been obtained from and is based upon sources that the Firm believes to be reliable, we do not guarantee its accuracy and it may
be incomplete and condensed. Note, however, that the Firm has taken all reasonable steps to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures
made in the Important Disclosures section of the Product. The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company(ies) referred
to in this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company(ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from
sending draft research to subject companies. However, it should be presumed that the author of the Product has had discussions with the subject company
to ensure factual accuracy prior to publication. All opinions, projections and estimates constitute the judgment of the author as of the date of the Product and
these, plus any other information contained in the Product, are subject to change without notice. Prices and availability of financial instruments also are
subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained
in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a
fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to
news affecting the issuer. For non-fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts
included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research
may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Citi Research may provide different research products and
services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long-term or short-term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or
recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is
consistent with the rating system for each respective product.
Investing in non-U.S. securities, including ADRs, may entail certain risks. The securities of non-U.S. issuers may not be registered with, nor be subject to the
reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There may be limited information available on foreign securities. Foreign
companies are generally not subject to uniform audit and reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those in the U.S. Securities of
some foreign companies may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. In addition, exchange rate
movements may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in a foreign stock and its corresponding dividend payment for U.S. investors. Net
dividends to ADR investors are estimated, using withholding tax rates conventions, deemed accurate, but investors are urged to consult their tax advisor for
exact dividend computations. Investors who have received the Product from the Firm may be prohibited in certain states or other jurisdictions from
purchasing securities mentioned in the Product from the Firm. Please ask your Financial Consultant for additional details. Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
