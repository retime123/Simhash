Strong 2Q; Slight Outlook Upgrade; CEO Succession
• What's Changing? — We revisit our forecasts following the 2Q17 results which
were ahead of market expectations. The Group has upgraded its FY17 earnings
guidance range by 1.5% - 2.0%. BFAM also announced that CEO David Lissy will
transition to the role of Executive Chairman and a successor has been identified.
We increase our EPS estimates by 1.5% on average through the forecast horizon.
On the back of this we increase our TP to $92 and retain our Buy rating.
• Results vs. Expectations — 2Q Revenue came in at $445.5mn, up 7.5% organic
(full service 5.25%; others 2.25%). This compares against Citi at $446.3mn and
consensus at $443.7mn. Adj. income from ops of $58.8mn (13.2% margin) was in
line with Citi at $59mn (13.2%) and ahead of consensus’ $58.3mn (13.1%). Adj.
EPS of $0.74 was higher than Citi at $0.71 and consensus at $0.72.
• Focus #1: New CEO — David Lissy (CEO since 2002) will transition to the role of
Exec Chairman effective 1 January 2018. Stephen Kramer, currently President, has
been identified as his successor. Mr. Kramer joined BFAM in 2006 following the
acquisition of College Coach. He has led various divisions at BFAM including
international ops, and has managed the Company’s global organic and acquisitions
strategy. Mr. Lissy suggested that international expansion and broadening the
group’s service offerings were areas that he expects to work with the new CEO on.

• Focus #2: Outlook — BFAM reiterated topline guidance for FY17, although adj.
eps is now guided to range $2.62 - $2.65 per share, about 1.5% - 2.0% above the
previous range. This is partly due to lower tax rate and share count. The group
reiterated that lease consortium centers were performing as expected. BFAM
acquired 7 centers in the Netherlands during the Q, and while FY17 is likely to be a
quiet year in terms of large M&A, the Group flagged a robust M&A pipeline.

• Model Update — We increase our EPS est. for FY17-21 by c.1.5%. We leave our
adj. EBIT margin ests. largely unchanged and continue to expect flattish
performance in FY17, followed by growth in margins in outer years as cost
headwinds abate. We reduce new center capex by $10mn in line with guidance.

Changes to Forecasts
We have updated our model for 2Q results and the updated guidance.
• We continue to estimate flattish YoY adjusted EBIT margins for FY17 on the back
of three cost head winds. 40 – 50 bps margin head wind due to the lower
margins and integration spend at Asquith, 10 – 20 bps drag from lease
consortium centers, and 40 – 50 bps due to the spend on IT. We estimate Group
margins will rise by c.80bps in each of FY18 & 19.
• FY17 depreciation charge is now guided to come in at $65mn vs. $70 - $75mn.
We reduce our estimate of depreciation for the outer years too by about 5%.
• The effective tax rate has been reduced to 26% from 27% earlier due to new
accounting for tax benefit on certain stock compensation transactions. We expect
tax rates to normalize to 30% in the outer years with higher rates in the US being
partly offset by lower rates in the UK and the Netherlands.
• We also reduce the diluted share count to 60.5mn for the FY, as guided, vs. our
previous estimate of a little over 61mn.
• We reduce capex by c.$10mn after the group reduced its estimate of new center
investment by to $40mn from $45mn - $50mn previously.
• Overall, this drives our EPS estimates higher by 0.5% - 2.0% between FY17 –
21.

Valuation
We use a DCF-based valuation analysis in order to derive our estimate of fair value.
The primary driver of DCF analysis is our estimate of enterprise FCF which we base
on EBITDA less capex (including center acquisitions) less (plus) working capital
outflows (inflows) less cash tax and less share-based payments. Our estimate of
enterprise FCF is in the table below –

On the DCF, we base it on a long-term growth rate of 2% which we believe is
consistent with its geographic exposure. For the discount rate we use a WACC of
7% including a cost of equity of ~8%. Overall this drives an estimate of fair value of
$92 which we set as our target price.

Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc.
Company description
Bright Horizons is a leading provider of child care, back-up dependent care, and
educational advisory services largely across the US, UK and Netherlands. The
Group operates just over 1,000 centers globally and serves around 1,100 corporate
clients, 150 of whom are Fortune 500 companies. Around 80% of the Group's
revenue is from North America.
Investment strategy
We rate Bright Horizons as Buy.
A combination of new centers, higher utilization, tuition fee increases, and cross-sell
opportunities should drive high-single-digit organic revenue growth and c.15%
earnings growth over the long term. The Trump Administration’s child care plans
could also act as a demand driver.
A highly cash-generative business combined with a history of successful
acquisitions implies the Group will partake in more opportunistic earnings-accretive
deals potentially raising the growth profile by up to a further 300bps.
Valuation
We use a DCF valuation, based on a long-term growth rate of 2% which we believe
is consistent with its geographic exposure. For the discount rate, we use a WACC of
7%. Overall this drives an estimate of fair value of $92 which we set as our target
price.
Risks
Downside risks to our target price include:
• An economic down-cycle could dampen demand for child care services.
Prepared for Rong Lu (research email)
• A sustained decline in fertility levels and female labour participation rates in highincome
countries could reduce structural demand for child care services.
• A contraction in supply of qualified child care workers could have an adverse
impact on the Group’s personnel costs.
• Over-paying for an M&A target, or failing to effectively integrate the target, could
impact profitability/returns.
• Bright Horizons is subject to a multitude of federal, state and local regulations.
Failing to meet these regulations could carry financial, reputational and
operational risk.
• Government intervention in terms of public funding for state-owned child care
centers, or direct intervention in pricing of the services, could adversely impact
demand and the profitability of Bright Horizons services.
Upside risks to our target price include:
• Strong improvements in fertility rates and female participation in full-time work
could result in greater-than-expected demand for child care services.

• President Trump has suggested providing tax deductions for individuals, and
incentivizing employers to set up onsite child care facilities. While, at the
moment, these plans are short on specifics, they could drive significantly higher
demand for child care.
• Multiple acquisitions could drive faster growth.
• Faster-than-expected expansion into newer geographies could drive higher-thanexpected
growth.
• Large-scale consolidation of child care centers, particularly in the US, could
reduce the pressure on personnel costs.

Guide to Citi Research Fundamental Research Investment Ratings:
Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks.
Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned.
Investment Ratings: Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return
("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The
Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not
assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment
catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and,
thus, not derive an ETR. Analysts may place covered stocks "Under Review" in response to exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the
analyst's thesis) affecting the company and / or trading in the company's securities (e.g. trading suspension). As soon as practically possible, the analyst will
publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Under Review and Neutral to Hold in our
ratings distribution table for our 12-month fundamental rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider Under Review to be a recommendation.
Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change
in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At other times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price
movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations from specified ranges will be permitted but will become subject to
review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made
only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.
Prior to May 1, 2014 Citi Research may have also assigned a three-month relative call (or rating) to a stock to highlight expected out-performance (most
preferred) or under-performance (least preferred) versus the geographic and industry sector over a 3 month period. The relative call may have highlighted a
specific near-term catalyst or event impacting the company or the market that was anticipated to have a short-term price impact on the equity securities of
the company. Absent any specific catalyst the analyst(s) may have indicated the most and least preferred stocks in the universe of stocks under
consideration, explaining the basis for this short-term view. This three-month view may have been different from and did not affect a stock's fundamental
equity rating, which reflected a longer-term total absolute return expectation.
Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside calls:
Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch Upside or Downside call to highlight specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the
market that are expected to influence the share price over a specified period of 30 or 90 days. A Catalyst Watch Upside (Downside) call indicates that the
analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over the specified period. A Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at
the end of the specified 30/90 day period; the analyst may also close a Catalyst Watch call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research
note. A Catalyst Watch Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock’s fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term
total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch Upside call corresponds to a buy
recommendation and a Catalyst Watch Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside or Catalyst
Watch Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch Non-Rated (CWNR). For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond CWNR
to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider CWNR to be a
recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as
expected.

Citi Research generally disseminates its research to the Firm’s global institutional and retail clients via both proprietary (e.g., Citi Velocity and Citi Personal
Wealth Management) and non-proprietary electronic distribution platforms. Certain research may be disseminated only via the Firm’s proprietary distribution
platforms; however such research will not contain changes to earnings forecasts, target price, investment or risk rating or investment thesis or be otherwise
inconsistent with the author’s previously published research. Certain research is made available only to institutional investors to satisfy regulatory
requirements. Individual Citi Research analysts may also opt to circulate published research to one or more clients by email; such email distribution is
discretionary and is done only after the research has been disseminated. The level and types of services provided by Citi Research analysts to clients may
vary depending on various factors such as the client’s individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communications from analysts, the
client’s risk profile and investment focus and perspective (e.g. market-wide, sector specific, long term, short-term etc.), the size and scope of the overall
client relationship with the Firm and legal and regulatory constraints.
Pursuant to Comissão de Valores Mobiliários Rule 483, Citi is required to disclose whether a Citi related company or business has a commercial relationship
with the subject company. Considering that Citi operates multiple businesses in more than 100 countries around the world, it is likely that Citi has a
commercial relationship with the subject company.
Securities recommended, offered, or sold by the Firm: (i) are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; (ii) are not deposits or other
obligations of any insured depository institution (including Citibank); and (iii) are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of the principal
amount invested. The Product is for informational purposes only and is not intended as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of a security. Any
decision to purchase securities mentioned in the Product must take into account existing public information on such security or any registered prospectus.
Although information has been obtained from and is based upon sources that the Firm believes to be reliable, we do not guarantee its accuracy and it may
be incomplete and condensed. Note, however, that the Firm has taken all reasonable steps to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures
made in the Important Disclosures section of the Product. The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company(ies) referred
to in this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company(ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from
sending draft research to subject companies. However, it should be presumed that the author of the Product has had discussions with the subject company
to ensure factual accuracy prior to publication. All opinions, projections and estimates constitute the judgment of the author as of the date of the Product and
these, plus any other information contained in the Product, are subject to change without notice. Prices and availability of financial instruments also are
subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained
in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a
fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to
news affecting the issuer. For non-fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts
included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research
may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Citi Research may provide different research products and
services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long-term or short-term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or
recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is
consistent with the rating system for each respective product.
Investing in non-U.S. securities, including ADRs, may entail certain risks. The securities of non-U.S. issuers may not be registered with, nor be subject to the
reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There may be limited information available on foreign securities. Foreign
companies are generally not subject to uniform audit and reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those in the U.S. Securities of
some foreign companies may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. In addition, exchange rate
movements may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in a foreign stock and its corresponding dividend payment for U.S. investors. Net
dividends to ADR investors are estimated, using withholding tax rates conventions, deemed accurate, but investors are urged to consult their tax advisor for
exact dividend computations. Investors who have received the Product from the Firm may be prohibited in certain states or other jurisdictions from
purchasing securities mentioned in the Product from the Firm. Please ask your Financial Consultant for additional details. Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
