Uneventful 2Q17; Numbers set up still looks compelling despite
headline noise
• No major surprises in Q2 results – License/product declined 4% y/y (Networking -
5%, Desktop -3%) though did face a tougher comp. Maintenance revenue
accelerated to +6% y/y from +3% y/y in Q1 on continued strong uptake of new
maintenance program (higher pricing). Desktop highlights included strong DD
license growth internationally offset by higher subscription uptake in U.S. impacting
license compare. Networking saw DD bookings growth in enterprise ADC and cloud
service customers with Bytemobile headwind offsetting these. Total revenue of
$693M was in-line with guidance and consistent with preannouncement.
• Margins lower than expected; Tax helps EPS – 2Q17 operating margins of
26.1% missed our/street by 220 bps on higher opex (S&M grew 9% vs. our 6%).
CEO Henshall noted opex is running ‘hot in 1H’ and they are taking a hard look
here. We expect given recent management change, expenses will not get out of
control. EPS was $0.01/$0.04 better than us/street but tax drove $0.09 of this.

(RIC: CTXS.O, BB: CTXS US)
• Little change in outlook – Revenue guidance for FY17 was slightly narrowed with
slightly more Q3 to Q4 seasonality while EPS was maintained. Embedded in the
outlook is much slower opex growth than 1H. We reflect higher Q4 seasonality and
lower Q4 opex growth in our model. Our headline revenue/EPS estimates don’t
change materially and still look conservative given much easier 2H comps.

• Stock View – We think recent headlines of CEO transition, speculation on sales
process and uncertainty around subscription transition have created more risk to a
story that had been largely stable for the past ~6 Qs. That said, we find it hard to
ignore that CTXS is one of cheapest stocks in our group and faces favorable set-up
the next few Qs with: 1) easier comps 2) maintenance price increases driving
revenue reacceleration; and 3) likely return of Netscaler Cloud SP spend. Shares
trade at just 10.4X our FY18 EV/FCFF, well below all infrastructure/legacy peers.
PT moves to $96 (13x FY18 FCFF of $1.08B) on slightly higher FCF/billings.

Citrix Systems, Inc.
Company description
Founded in 1989, Citrix has a deep history in the client computing market and a
close history working with Microsoft to extend the Windows platform. The
company’s largest franchise, XenApp, has a 10+ year history in the market (formerly
known as Presentation Server, MetaFrame and Winframe) and was once the only
product. Over the last five years, the company has aggressively diversified, with
Desktop Solutions now contributing ~55% of revenue. New markets include
application networking (Netscaler), collaboration software as a service (Citrix
Online) and desktop and server virtualization (XenDesktop and Xen Server).
Investment strategy
With near-term prospects for accelerating top-line growth and upside to numbers,
we think the stock deserves a higher multiple than the current 10-11x NTM
EV/FCFF. Citrix remains one of our top picks given upward bias to numbers that are
poised to show reacceleration, improving profitability, ratable shift and capital return.
After spin/transaction noise settles and core trends are clearer, we expect investors
to better recognize prospects for improving growth/profitability, maintenance uplift,
ratable shift and capital return. We rate the stock a Buy.
Valuation
Our $96 PT equates to ~13x our 2018 EV/ FCFF estimate of $1.08B. The multiple is
towards the low-end of CTXS' historical trading range.
Risks
We see risks that restructuring activities could negatively impact revenue (much like
they did in 1H15). Other risks to our price target include:
Prepared for Rong Lu (research email)
Slower-than-expected adoption of the company's XenDesktop product. This could
happen if enterprises continue to question the value proposition of virtual desktops.
Heightened interest in mobile offering could also continue to stall contract
discussions. Demand for this product has been impacted by depressed IT spending
and lower user counts among customers.
A larger-than-expected weakening in IT spending or deceleration in new projects
within IT could drive lower-than-expected purchases of Citrix products than we
model.
The Datacenter product line has generated the majority of Citrix's outperformance.
A slowdown in the business's +20% Y/Y growth would likely limit the upside
potential.

Guide to Citi Research Fundamental Research Investment Ratings:
Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks.
Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned.
Investment Ratings: Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return
("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The
Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not
assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment
catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and,
thus, not derive an ETR. Analysts may place covered stocks "Under Review" in response to exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the
analyst's thesis) affecting the company and / or trading in the company's securities (e.g. trading suspension). As soon as practically possible, the analyst will
publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Under Review and Neutral to Hold in our
ratings distribution table for our 12-month fundamental rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider Under Review to be a recommendation.
Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change
in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At other times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price
movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations from specified ranges will be permitted but will become subject to
review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made
only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.
Prior to May 1, 2014 Citi Research may have also assigned a three-month relative call (or rating) to a stock to highlight expected out-performance (most
preferred) or under-performance (least preferred) versus the geographic and industry sector over a 3 month period. The relative call may have highlighted a
9
Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS)
3 August 2017 Citi Research
Prepared for Rong Lu (research email)
specific near-term catalyst or event impacting the company or the market that was anticipated to have a short-term price impact on the equity securities of
the company. Absent any specific catalyst the analyst(s) may have indicated the most and least preferred stocks in the universe of stocks under
consideration, explaining the basis for this short-term view. This three-month view may have been different from and did not affect a stock's fundamental
equity rating, which reflected a longer-term total absolute return expectation.
Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside calls:
Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch Upside or Downside call to highlight specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the
market that are expected to influence the share price over a specified period of 30 or 90 days. A Catalyst Watch Upside (Downside) call indicates that the
analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over the specified period. A Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at
the end of the specified 30/90 day period; the analyst may also close a Catalyst Watch call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research
note. A Catalyst Watch Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock’s fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term
total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch Upside call corresponds to a buy
recommendation and a Catalyst Watch Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside or Catalyst
Watch Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch Non-Rated (CWNR). For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond CWNR
to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider CWNR to be a
recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as
expected.

Citi Research generally disseminates its research to the Firm’s global institutional and retail clients via both proprietary (e.g., Citi Velocity and Citi Personal
Wealth Management) and non-proprietary electronic distribution platforms. Certain research may be disseminated only via the Firm’s proprietary distribution
platforms; however such research will not contain changes to earnings forecasts, target price, investment or risk rating or investment thesis or be otherwise
inconsistent with the author’s previously published research. Certain research is made available only to institutional investors to satisfy regulatory
requirements. Individual Citi Research analysts may also opt to circulate published research to one or more clients by email; such email distribution is
discretionary and is done only after the research has been disseminated. The level and types of services provided by Citi Research analysts to clients may
vary depending on various factors such as the client’s individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communications from analysts, the
client’s risk profile and investment focus and perspective (e.g. market-wide, sector specific, long term, short-term etc.), the size and scope of the overall
client relationship with the Firm and legal and regulatory constraints.
Pursuant to Comissão de Valores Mobiliários Rule 483, Citi is required to disclose whether a Citi related company or business has a commercial relationship
with the subject company. Considering that Citi operates multiple businesses in more than 100 countries around the world, it is likely that Citi has a
commercial relationship with the subject company.
Securities recommended, offered, or sold by the Firm: (i) are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; (ii) are not deposits or other
obligations of any insured depository institution (including Citibank); and (iii) are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of the principal
amount invested. The Product is for informational purposes only and is not intended as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of a security. Any
decision to purchase securities mentioned in the Product must take into account existing public information on such security or any registered prospectus.
Although information has been obtained from and is based upon sources that the Firm believes to be reliable, we do not guarantee its accuracy and it may
be incomplete and condensed. Note, however, that the Firm has taken all reasonable steps to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures

these, plus any other information contained in the Product, are subject to change without notice. Prices and availability of financial instruments also are

in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a
fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to
news affecting the issuer. For non-fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts
included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research
may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Citi Research may provide different research products and
services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long-term or short-term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or
recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is
consistent with the rating system for each respective product.
Investing in non-U.S. securities, including ADRs, may entail certain risks. The securities of non-U.S. issuers may not be registered with, nor be subject to the
reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There may be limited information available on foreign securities. Foreign
companies are generally not subject to uniform audit and reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those in the U.S. Securities of
some foreign companies may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. In addition, exchange rate
movements may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in a foreign stock and its corresponding dividend payment for U.S. investors. Net
dividends to ADR investors are estimated, using withholding tax rates conventions, deemed accurate, but investors are urged to consult their tax advisor for
exact dividend computations. Investors who have received the Product from the Firm may be prohibited in certain states or other jurisdictions from
