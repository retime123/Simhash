EPS Beat and Guidance Raise Lead to Sharp Stock Sell Off? We
Maintain Buy Rating
• ENR Stock Traded Off Nearly 9% Today — ENR reported a 3Q this morning that
beat consensus EPS expectations owing to strong productivity improvements.
However, ENR’s organic top line growth fell short of our expectations owing to
several factors (timing of new distribution, higher promotional activity, an increased
level of competitive activity in Asia). Importantly, ENR stated that despite investor
concerns about stepped-up competitive activity (especially from AmazonBasics), it
believes that it continues to gain market share in the overall battery market.
• Raising FY17 EPS Estimate — We are raising our FY17 pro forma EPS estimate
by 8 cents to $2.88 (+24% YoY), which is in-line with management’s revised
guidance for $2.85-$2.90. While ENR actually beat our 3Q estimate by 14 cents
today, we are lowering our 4Q estimate to reflect our expectation for a greater level
of investment spending in 4Q. Our FY18 EPS increases by 3 cents to $2.97 (+3%
YoY), and our FY19 becomes $3.10 (+4% YoY), such that our CY18 EPS is $3.00.

• Lowering Target Price but Maintaining Buy Rating — We are lowering our target
valuation for ENR, from a 30% premium to the market to the market multiple, given
our belief that in the near-term, investors will remain skeptical of ENR’s ability to
post much top line growth in the face of heightened competitive activity. While we
are optimistic that ENR will continue to gain market share in the global battery
category (as it has historically, given its strong track record of building brand equity
through both innovation and marketing), we think this investor anxiety will likely
persist for some time to come. Indeed, one important inflection point will be in early
November 2017, when ENR will report its 4Q (and hopefully deliver upon its
guidance for positive organic sales growth YoY in 4Q (vs. -3% YoY in 3Q), and offer
encouraging FY18 sales and EPS guidance). Given the now-higher 18x market
multiple based upon Citi's forecast for S&P 500 2018 EPS and our CY18 EPS
estimate of $3.00, we derive a new target price of $54. With an ETR of 26%, we
maintain our Buy rating.

Energizer Holdings (ENR)
2 August 2017 Citi Research
Energizer Holdings
Company description
ENR is the business that was spun-off of the former Energizer Holdings, effective
July 1, 2015. The break-up of “Old Energizer” was announced in April 2014, as prior
management argued at the time that splitting the company into two smaller, more
focused businesses would create more value for shareholders over time. ENR’s
$1.6 bn of revenues is split across the four geographic segments of North America
(54% of total sales), EMEA (22%), Asia Pacific (17%), and Latin America (7%) and
are primarily in Batteries (at 92% of total sales). Developed markets represent
~75% of sales such that developing markets are ~25% of sales.
Investment strategy
We rate ENR a Buy. While we expect organic growth for the battery category will
remain tepid for the foreseeable future, we like the outlook for steady cash flows for
ENR driven in part by further improvements in working capital. We expect that this
strong cash flow will be used to fund both healthy share repurchases and increases
to the dividend.
Valuation
We forecast ENR’s fiscal year 2018 EPS to be $2.97 and its calendar year to be
$3.00. Given our outlook for mid-single-digit EPS growth for ENR thereafter,
coupled with its relatively healthy dividend yield, we believe that ENR should trade
at the market multiple. Currently, Citi's estimate for the 2018 S&P 500 EPS implies a
~18x multiple on 2018 EPS. Based upon our CY18 EPS forecast of $3.00, this
derives our target price of $54.
Risks
Prepared for Rong Lu (research email)
The primary risk to the ENR story that we see is the competitive dynamic, driven by
the ongoing decline of the total batteries category. While the outlook for tepid
category growth seems to be relatively well understood by investors, the wild card is
how Duracell will be managed going forward. And, with SPB also a strong player,
we think it could be difficult to forecast accurately ENR’s sales, profits and EPS
especially on a quarterly basis, but also on an annual basis. Another risk to the ENR
story is the ability of management to execute upon its strategy of continued cost
cutting and working capital improvement—as given the weak underlying category
fundamentals, the ability for this company to fund its dividend and share
repurchases will depend on management’s ability to grow its cash flow. If
management fails to deliver on its objective of generating strong and growing cash
flows for the underlying business, and/or becomes distracted with potential M&A,
we see this as a real pressure on ENR achieving the target price we forecast.

Analysts’ compensation is determined by Citi Research management and Citigroup’s senior management and is based upon activities and services intended
to benefit the investor clients of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and its affiliates (the “Firm”). Compensation is not linked to specific transactions or
recommendations. Like all Firm employees, analysts receive compensation that is impacted by overall Firm profitability which includes investment banking,
sales and trading, and principal trading revenues. One factor in equity research analyst compensation is arranging corporate access events between
institutional clients and the management teams of covered companies. Typically, company management is more likely to participate when the analyst has a
positive view of the company.
For securities recommended in the Product in which the Firm is not a market maker, the Firm is a liquidity provider in the issuers' financial instruments and
may act as principal in connection with such transactions. The Firm is a regular issuer of traded financial instruments linked to securities that may have been
recommended in the Product. The Firm regularly trades in the securities of the issuer(s) discussed in the Product. The Firm may engage in securities
transactions in a manner inconsistent with the Product and, with respect to securities covered by the Product, will buy or sell from customers on a principal
basis.
The Firm is a market maker in the publicly traded equity securities of Energizer Holdings.

Guide to Citi Research Fundamental Research Investment Ratings:
Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks.
Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned.
Investment Ratings: Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return
("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The
Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not
assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment
catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and,
thus, not derive an ETR. Analysts may place covered stocks "Under Review" in response to exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the
analyst's thesis) affecting the company and / or trading in the company's securities (e.g. trading suspension). As soon as practically possible, the analyst will
publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Under Review and Neutral to Hold in our
ratings distribution table for our 12-month fundamental rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider Under Review to be a recommendation.
Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change
in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At other times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price
movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations from specified ranges will be permitted but will become subject to
review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made
only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.
Prior to May 1, 2014 Citi Research may have also assigned a three-month relative call (or rating) to a stock to highlight expected out-performance (most
preferred) or under-performance (least preferred) versus the geographic and industry sector over a 3 month period. The relative call may have highlighted a
specific near-term catalyst or event impacting the company or the market that was anticipated to have a short-term price impact on the equity securities of
the company. Absent any specific catalyst the analyst(s) may have indicated the most and least preferred stocks in the universe of stocks under
consideration, explaining the basis for this short-term view. This three-month view may have been different from and did not affect a stock's fundamental
equity rating, which reflected a longer-term total absolute return expectation.
Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside calls:
Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch Upside or Downside call to highlight specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the
market that are expected to influence the share price over a specified period of 30 or 90 days. A Catalyst Watch Upside (Downside) call indicates that the
analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over the specified period. A Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at
the end of the specified 30/90 day period; the analyst may also close a Catalyst Watch call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research
note. A Catalyst Watch Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock’s fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term
total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch Upside call corresponds to a buy
recommendation and a Catalyst Watch Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside or Catalyst
Watch Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch Non-Rated (CWNR). For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond CWNR
to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider CWNR to be a
recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as
expected.

Citi Research generally disseminates its research to the Firm’s global institutional and retail clients via both proprietary (e.g., Citi Velocity and Citi Personal
Wealth Management) and non-proprietary electronic distribution platforms. Certain research may be disseminated only via the Firm’s proprietary distribution
platforms; however such research will not contain changes to earnings forecasts, target price, investment or risk rating or investment thesis or be otherwise
inconsistent with the author’s previously published research. Certain research is made available only to institutional investors to satisfy regulatory
requirements. Individual Citi Research analysts may also opt to circulate published research to one or more clients by email; such email distribution is
discretionary and is done only after the research has been disseminated. The level and types of services provided by Citi Research analysts to clients may
vary depending on various factors such as the client’s individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communications from analysts, the
client’s risk profile and investment focus and perspective (e.g. market-wide, sector specific, long term, short-term etc.), the size and scope of the overall
client relationship with the Firm and legal and regulatory constraints.
Pursuant to Comissão de Valores Mobiliários Rule 483, Citi is required to disclose whether a Citi related company or business has a commercial relationship
with the subject company. Considering that Citi operates multiple businesses in more than 100 countries around the world, it is likely that Citi has a
commercial relationship with the subject company.
Securities recommended, offered, or sold by the Firm: (i) are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; (ii) are not deposits or other

be incomplete and condensed. Note, however, that the Firm has taken all reasonable steps to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures
made in the Important Disclosures section of the Product. The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company(ies) referred
to in this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company(ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from
sending draft research to subject companies. However, it should be presumed that the author of the Product has had discussions with the subject company

these, plus any other information contained in the Product, are subject to change without notice. Prices and availability of financial instruments also are
subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained
in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a
fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to
news affecting the issuer. For non-fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts
included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research
may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Citi Research may provide different research products and
services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long-term or short-term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or
recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is
consistent with the rating system for each respective product.
