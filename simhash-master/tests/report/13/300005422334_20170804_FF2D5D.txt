Proving the Naysayers Wrong, One VaporMax at a Time; Buy NKE
• Q4 & FY18 Guidance Beat Should Help Alleviate Recent Investor Concerns —
NKE reported a Q4 beat and introduced FY18 guidance ahead of expectations,
underscoring the brand’s ability to drive continued innovation, evolve with the
shifting competitive landscape, and execute on its long-term initiatives despite
broader industry and f/x pressures. While North America remains a softer spot in the
near-term (into 1H), mgmt’s product/door repositioning & cleaner inventories appear
to be headed in the right direction. Meanwhile, Nike’s category offense continues to
drive robust growth in int’l markets, led by China, Western Europe, and Emerging
Markets. Finally, we remain encouraged that the company is adapting to the
shifting consumer environment with a more aggressive focus on DTC, building out
faster growth channels like mobile & e-commerce (owned & wholesale, incl. a new
limited test at AMZN), and driving supply chain efficiencies & faster speed to
market, all while keeping their foot on the pedal on new product technology.

• Yes, Guidance is 2H-Weighted, but Global Strategy is Working – FY18 rev
guidance of +MSD (+MSD-HSD ex-f/x) beat Buy-side expectations of +LSD, but
incorporates a tougher setup for Q1/1H due to f/x, timing of realignment spend,
exiting golf, & lapping the Olympics. While investors tend to be more wary of 2H-wtd
outlooks, we note that revs remain strong outside of the US, which buys time for the
US to recover, in our view. Further, mgmt’s confidence in the new platforms based
on strong early sell-throughs & demand also give us more confidence in the guide.

• Implications; Reiterate Buy — Consistent with our Q4 preview, we expect NKE’s
stock to move higher on the Q4 beat and guidance coming roughly in-line with
consensus (& above investor expectations). While North America trends remain
challenging, inventories have improved and mgmt has proven they can turn
struggling businesses around in the past (for ex. China). In addition, we continue to
be bullish on how Nike’s new product platforms & upcoming NBA relationship can
drive the core NA business over the next two years. We updated our EPS
estimates and maintained our target price of $65 (see details below).

FY18 Guidance Ahead of Expectations
Following more preliminary guidance in Q3 than they had historically provided,
management today introduced FY18 guidance ahead of expectations. Full year
revenues are expected to grow +MSD y/y, or +MSD-HSD excluding foreign
currency headwinds, with positive growth across all geographies led by
international. US growth is expected to be back-half weighted on a bigger 1H drag
and as Nike repositions away from less productive/differentiated points of
distribution.
Gross margins are expected to exceed the company’s long-term goals of +30-50bps
annual expansion on a currency neutral basis, but contract up to 50bps y/y including
f/x headwinds (declines weighted toward 1H). SG&A is expected to grow +MSD,
with the cost of previously announced leadership/organizational realignment
expected to be primarily focused in 1H and the majority of savings to be reinvested
in growth initiatives. Excluding f/x, EBIT is expected to grow +DD y/y in FY18, also
in-line with long-term goals. Based on current f/x rates, f/x is expected to be a
~$700M headwind in FY18 as Nike’s previously favorable hedges mature and roll
forward. Other Income and Expense net of interest expense were guided in the
$30-50M range, while the effective tax rate is expected to be 16-18% (up from
13.2% last year, which benefited from a one-time IRS tax benefit in Q1).
Q1 results are expected to see disproportionately negative impact from f/x, exiting
the golf business, and lapping last year’s Olympics. Reported revenues are
expected to be flat y/y, with gross margins contracting 150-180bps on f/x
headwinds, and SG&A up MSD y/y. Other expense (net of interest expense) is
expected in the range of $10-20M. Based on current f/x rates, FY19 and beyond
are expected to see more neutral f/x impact, with positive top-line growth on both a
reported and currency-neutral basis.
Updating Estimates; Target Price Remains $65
Prepared for Rong Lu (research email)
We updated our estimates following the company’s FY18 guidance issuance and
cadence for the year. Our FY18 EPS goes to $2.45 (from $2.61 previously) to
reflect more conservative top-line assumptions in Q1 and for the full year. We are
now forecasting 5.6% top-line growth for the year including f/x, roughly consistent
with guidance of +MSD reported growth.
Our FY19 EPS goes to $3.00 from $3.15 as we roughly maintained our y/y growth
assumptions (we continue to forecast 7% top-line growth). Our target price on Nike
remains based on a discounted cash flow analysis and is unchanged at $65.
Please see our updated income statement in Figure 1 below.
Q4 Review
Nike reported fiscal Q4’17 EPS of $0.60, beating our estimate of $0.53 and
consensus of $0.50 on slightly better revenues, SG&A, other income, and lower
than expected taxes. A lower than guided tax rate contributed approximately $0.06
to EPS, still implying a beat for the quarter.
Revenues grew 5.3% y/y to $8.68B (up 7% in constant currency), driven by
currency neutral growth of 0.5% in North America (outperforming reported futures of
-9% last quarter), 12% in Western Europe, 6% in C/E Europe, 16% in Greater
China, 5% in Japan, and 18% in Emerging Markets. Converse grew 10% ex-f/x.
Results were in-line with a Q4 top-line increase of +MSD% y/y, or +HSD excluding
currency.

29 June 2017 Citi Research
Gross margins contracted 180bps y/y to 44.1% (vs. guidance of 150-175bps), with
higher ASPs more than offset by 140bps of negative f/x and higher product costs.
SG&A declined another 3.7% y/y, vs. guidance of flat, on declines in both operating
overhead and demand creation expenses (marketing was shifted earlier in the fiscal
year due to timing of the Olympics and Euro Champs). The effective tax rate
declined to 13.7% from 21.2% last year (and vs. guidance of ~22%), which
management attributed to mix shift toward non-US earnings (which are generally
subject to a lower tax rate).
Nike ended the year with $6.18B in cash and short-term investments, up from
$5.46B last year, and $3.8B in total debt (up from $2.1B LY). Inventories increased
4.5% y/y, below top-line growth in the quarter and roughly in-line with guidance for
the upcoming fiscal year. While Nike brand wholesale unit inventories declined 3%
y/y (in-line with last quarter), the decline was again more than offset by increases in
average product cost per unit and higher inventories around the DTC business.
The company repurchased $820M in shares in Q4 and $3.3B for the full year.

Nike Inc
Company description
NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries design, develop, and market footwear, apparel,
equipment, and accessory products worldwide. The company also owns Jordan,
Converse, Nike Golf, and Hurley brands. NIKE was co-founded by Philip H. Knight
in 1964 and is headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon.
Investment strategy
We assign Nike a Buy rating. We view Nike as a leading player in the global apparel
and footwear space with opportunities for long-term growth from the women's
business, direct-to-consumer expansion, continued innovation, and a strong cash
position. We think continued strength in China and European trends will likely result
in more margin upside over the next several years which should result in a higher
valuation.
Valuation
Our $65 target price on Nike is based on a discounted cash flow analysis. We
believe a DCF is an appropriate way to value the company given the current
volatility of the market, while also taking into account NKE’s strong cash flows. Our
DCF assumes a WACC of approximately 7.3% and terminal value of 3%.
Risks
The following risk factors could impede Nike shares from reaching our target price:
• Continued consolidation of retailers, which could create a stronger customer.
• Possible slowdown of consumer spending in the U.S. and Europe.
Prepared for Rong Lu (research email)
Appendix A-1
Analyst Certification
• International Risk – Roughly 60% of Nike’s sales are outside the United States.
On the cost side, 98% of Nike’s footwear production and most of Nike’s apparel
production is manufactured outside the U.S. We also see increased near-term
risk related to Brexit uncertainty for the UK/Europe market and potentially
broader implications. Any adverse change in currency could negatively impact
Nike’s bottom line. Furthermore, any change in import safeguards in the U.S.
and/or Europe could have an adverse impact on Nike’s production.

Guide to Citi Research Fundamental Research Investment Ratings:
Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks.
Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned.
Investment Ratings: Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return
("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The
Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not
assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment
catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and,
thus, not derive an ETR. Analysts may place covered stocks "Under Review" in response to exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the
analyst's thesis) affecting the company and / or trading in the company's securities (e.g. trading suspension). As soon as practically possible, the analyst will
publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Under Review and Neutral to Hold in our
ratings distribution table for our 12-month fundamental rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider Under Review to be a recommendation.
Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change
in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At other times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price
movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations from specified ranges will be permitted but will become subject to
review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made
only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.
Prior to May 1, 2014 Citi Research may have also assigned a three-month relative call (or rating) to a stock to highlight expected out-performance (most
preferred) or under-performance (least preferred) versus the geographic and industry sector over a 3 month period. The relative call may have highlighted a
specific near-term catalyst or event impacting the company or the market that was anticipated to have a short-term price impact on the equity securities of
the company. Absent any specific catalyst the analyst(s) may have indicated the most and least preferred stocks in the universe of stocks under
consideration, explaining the basis for this short-term view. This three-month view may have been different from and did not affect a stock's fundamental
equity rating, which reflected a longer-term total absolute return expectation.
Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside calls:
Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch Upside or Downside call to highlight specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the
market that are expected to influence the share price over a specified period of 30 or 90 days. A Catalyst Watch Upside (Downside) call indicates that the
analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over the specified period. A Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at
the end of the specified 30/90 day period; the analyst may also close a Catalyst Watch call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research
note. A Catalyst Watch Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock’s fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term
total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch Upside call corresponds to a buy
recommendation and a Catalyst Watch Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside or Catalyst
Watch Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch Non-Rated (CWNR). For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond CWNR
to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider CWNR to be a
recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as
expected.

Citi Research generally disseminates its research to the Firm’s global institutional and retail clients via both proprietary (e.g., Citi Velocity and Citi Personal
Wealth Management) and non-proprietary electronic distribution platforms. Certain research may be disseminated only via the Firm’s proprietary distribution
platforms; however such research will not contain changes to earnings forecasts, target price, investment or risk rating or investment thesis or be otherwise
inconsistent with the author’s previously published research. Certain research is made available only to institutional investors to satisfy regulatory
requirements. Individual Citi Research analysts may also opt to circulate published research to one or more clients by email; such email distribution is
discretionary and is done only after the research has been disseminated. The level and types of services provided by Citi Research analysts to clients may
vary depending on various factors such as the client’s individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communications from analysts, the
client’s risk profile and investment focus and perspective (e.g. market-wide, sector specific, long term, short-term etc.), the size and scope of the overall
client relationship with the Firm and legal and regulatory constraints.
Pursuant to Comissão de Valores Mobiliários Rule 483, Citi is required to disclose whether a Citi related company or business has a commercial relationship
with the subject company. Considering that Citi operates multiple businesses in more than 100 countries around the world, it is likely that Citi has a
commercial relationship with the subject company.
Securities recommended, offered, or sold by the Firm: (i) are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; (ii) are not deposits or other
obligations of any insured depository institution (including Citibank); and (iii) are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of the principal
amount invested. The Product is for informational purposes only and is not intended as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of a security. Any
decision to purchase securities mentioned in the Product must take into account existing public information on such security or any registered prospectus.
Although information has been obtained from and is based upon sources that the Firm believes to be reliable, we do not guarantee its accuracy and it may
be incomplete and condensed. Note, however, that the Firm has taken all reasonable steps to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures
made in the Important Disclosures section of the Product. The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company(ies) referred
to in this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company(ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from
sending draft research to subject companies. However, it should be presumed that the author of the Product has had discussions with the subject company
to ensure factual accuracy prior to publication. All opinions, projections and estimates constitute the judgment of the author as of the date of the Product and
these, plus any other information contained in the Product, are subject to change without notice. Prices and availability of financial instruments also are
subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained
in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a
fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to
news affecting the issuer. For non-fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts
included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research
may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Citi Research may provide different research products and
services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long-term or short-term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or
recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is
consistent with the rating system for each respective product.
Investing in non-U.S. securities, including ADRs, may entail certain risks. The securities of non-U.S. issuers may not be registered with, nor be subject to the
reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There may be limited information available on foreign securities. Foreign
companies are generally not subject to uniform audit and reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those in the U.S. Securities of
some foreign companies may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. In addition, exchange rate
movements may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in a foreign stock and its corresponding dividend payment for U.S. investors. Net
dividends to ADR investors are estimated, using withholding tax rates conventions, deemed accurate, but investors are urged to consult their tax advisor for
exact dividend computations. Investors who have received the Product from the Firm may be prohibited in certain states or other jurisdictions from
purchasing securities mentioned in the Product from the Firm. Please ask your Financial Consultant for additional details. Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
