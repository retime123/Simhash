Mitsui & Co. (8031)
Results: Q1 positive—prices favorable, but we like high profits
• Citi's Take — April-June NP was ¥110.8bn (+¥49.7bn YoY), ahead of our forecast
and a Nikkei preview. The main reason for YoY growth was favorable market prices
(+¥39bn), but we see strong progress toward targets for non-resource business
profits as positive. However, its shares rose less than those of Sumitomo Corp. after
results were announced, due perhaps to higher resource costs and concern about
lower profits in some segments (chemicals, etc.).
• What drove the numbers — In addition to favorable market prices, Mitsui
benefitted from improvement in basic earnings power (steel products and LNG
dividends, etc.; +¥6bn) and asset recycling (+¥4bn). At the same time, resource
cost and volume factors trimmed ¥2bn. The impact of market prices was large,
breaking down to +¥16bn for coal, +¥14bn for iron ore, and +¥9bn for crude oil and
gas. In non-resource businesses, lower profits from chemicals (methionine) and
grain collection and sales were offset by gains on real estate sales and increased
trading in steel products and foods.
• What this means for full-year earnings — Methionine profits were down sharply,
but some improvement is expected due to a price hike from July. Trading
gains/losses occur on a quarterly basis. In July-September a change in the Vale
shareholder structuring is expected to generate gains. Results suggest a greater
chance that nominal profits will be above our forecasts, and adjusted profits look as
if they could beat plan as well.
• Implications — If Mitsui can improve the resource cost/volume impact and
methionine business and maintain strong steel product earnings it may be seen as
a step toward achieving medium-term targets. This could improve market sentiment.

Mitsui & Co. (8031)
3 August 2017 Citi Research
Mitsui & Co.
Valuation
We use PBR as our valuation metric for Mitsui & Co. We do so because 1) sector
stocks are strongly correlated with the market (we stress relative PBR), 2) there is a
strong correlation between RoE, RoIC, RoA, and relative PBR, 3) historical relative
PBRs have been mainly range-bound.
In calculating our ¥1,800 target price, we set the relative PBR at c60%, which is at
the low end of the historical range, as we are bearish on longer-term iron ore prices,
note the volatility of macro factors like resource prices and forex, and regard RoE is
weak. Referencing TOPIX PBR, we calculate a target PBR of c0.8x, which we apply
to our BPS forecast for FY3/18.
Our target price corresponds to a dividend yield of 3.4% on our FY3/19 forecasts,
which is within range of yields at sector firms (including on a historical basis) and
which we see as broadly appropriate.
Risks
We see downside risks to our target price as 1) continued sluggish profits in nonresource
businesses; 2) a fall in the price of iron ore; 3) deteriorating conditions (in
terms of weather, politics, and labor) in resource-producing areas like Brazil and
Australia; and 4) a fall for the TOPIX PBR due to economic slowness. On the other
hand, upside risks are 1) past spending in non-resource businesses bearing fruit; 2)
a rise in the price of iron ore; 3) expanded shareholders' return via the raising of the
dividend payout; 4) a rise in RoE due to share buybacks; and 5) a rise for the
TOPIX PBR due to an economic upturn. We estimate the sensitivity of NP to price
fluctuations as 1) -¥2bn or so for every ¥1/$ appreciation, 2) -¥1.7bn or so for every
¥1/AUD appreciation, 3) -¥400mn or so for every ¥1/BRL appreciation, 4) +¥2.8bn
or so for every $1/bbl rise in the crude price, and 5) +¥2.5bn or so for every $1/MT
rise in the iron ore price. If these factors manifest themselves differently than we
have anticipated, the share price may not achieve our target price.

Guide to Citi Research Fundamental Research Investment Ratings:
Citi Research stock recommendations include an investment rating and an optional risk rating to highlight high risk stocks.
Risk rating takes into account both price volatility and fundamental criteria. Stocks will either have no risk rating or a High risk rating assigned.
Investment Ratings: Citi Research investment ratings are Buy, Neutral and Sell. Our ratings are a function of analyst expectations of expected total return
("ETR") and risk. ETR is the sum of the forecast price appreciation (or depreciation) plus the dividend yield for a stock within the next 12 months. The
Investment rating definitions are: Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. Any covered stock not
assigned a Buy or a Sell is a Neutral (2). For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment
catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and,
thus, not derive an ETR. Analysts may place covered stocks "Under Review" in response to exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of information critical to the
analyst's thesis) affecting the company and / or trading in the company's securities (e.g. trading suspension). As soon as practically possible, the analyst will
publish a note re-establishing a rating and investment thesis. To satisfy regulatory requirements, we correspond Under Review and Neutral to Hold in our
ratings distribution table for our 12-month fundamental rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider Under Review to be a recommendation.
Investment ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in investment and/or risk rating, or a change
in target price (subject to limited management discretion). At other times, the expected total returns may fall outside of these ranges because of market price
movements and/or other short-term volatility or trading patterns. Such interim deviations from specified ranges will be permitted but will become subject to
review by Research Management. Your decision to buy or sell a security should be based upon your personal investment objectives and should be made
only after evaluating the stock's expected performance and risk.
Prior to May 1, 2014 Citi Research may have also assigned a three-month relative call (or rating) to a stock to highlight expected out-performance (most
preferred) or under-performance (least preferred) versus the geographic and industry sector over a 3 month period. The relative call may have highlighted a
specific near-term catalyst or event impacting the company or the market that was anticipated to have a short-term price impact on the equity securities of
the company. Absent any specific catalyst the analyst(s) may have indicated the most and least preferred stocks in the universe of stocks under
consideration, explaining the basis for this short-term view. This three-month view may have been different from and did not affect a stock's fundamental
equity rating, which reflected a longer-term total absolute return expectation.
Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside calls:
Citi Research may also include a Catalyst Watch Upside or Downside call to highlight specific near-term catalysts or events impacting the company or the
market that are expected to influence the share price over a specified period of 30 or 90 days. A Catalyst Watch Upside (Downside) call indicates that the
analyst expects the share price to rise (fall) in absolute terms over the specified period. A Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside call will automatically expire at
the end of the specified 30/90 day period; the analyst may also close a Catalyst Watch call prior to the end of the specified period in a published research
note. A Catalyst Watch Upside or Downside call may be different from and does not affect a stock’s fundamental equity rating, which reflects a longer-term
total absolute return expectation. For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, a Catalyst Watch Upside call corresponds to a buy
recommendation and a Catalyst Watch Downside call corresponds to a sell recommendation. Any stock not assigned to a Catalyst Watch Upside or Catalyst
Watch Downside call is considered Catalyst Watch Non-Rated (CWNR). For purposes of FINRA ratings-distribution-disclosure rules, we correspond CWNR
to Hold in our ratings distribution table for our Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside rating system. However, we reiterate that we do not consider CWNR to be a
recommendation. For all Catalyst Watch Upside/Downside calls, risk exists that the catalyst(s) and associated share-price movement will not materialize as
expected.

Citi Research generally disseminates its research to the Firm’s global institutional and retail clients via both proprietary (e.g., Citi Velocity and Citi Personal
Wealth Management) and non-proprietary electronic distribution platforms. Certain research may be disseminated only via the Firm’s proprietary distribution
platforms; however such research will not contain changes to earnings forecasts, target price, investment or risk rating or investment thesis or be otherwise
inconsistent with the author’s previously published research. Certain research is made available only to institutional investors to satisfy regulatory
requirements. Individual Citi Research analysts may also opt to circulate published research to one or more clients by email; such email distribution is
discretionary and is done only after the research has been disseminated. The level and types of services provided by Citi Research analysts to clients may
vary depending on various factors such as the client’s individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communications from analysts, the
client’s risk profile and investment focus and perspective (e.g. market-wide, sector specific, long term, short-term etc.), the size and scope of the overall
client relationship with the Firm and legal and regulatory constraints.
Pursuant to Comissão de Valores Mobiliários Rule 483, Citi is required to disclose whether a Citi related company or business has a commercial relationship
with the subject company. Considering that Citi operates multiple businesses in more than 100 countries around the world, it is likely that Citi has a
commercial relationship with the subject company.
Securities recommended, offered, or sold by the Firm: (i) are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; (ii) are not deposits or other
obligations of any insured depository institution (including Citibank); and (iii) are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of the principal
amount invested. The Product is for informational purposes only and is not intended as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of a security. Any

Although information has been obtained from and is based upon sources that the Firm believes to be reliable, we do not guarantee its accuracy and it may
be incomplete and condensed. Note, however, that the Firm has taken all reasonable steps to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures
made in the Important Disclosures section of the Product. The Firm's research department has received assistance from the subject company(ies) referred
to in this Product including, but not limited to, discussions with management of the subject company(ies). Firm policy prohibits research analysts from
sending draft research to subject companies. However, it should be presumed that the author of the Product has had discussions with the subject company
to ensure factual accuracy prior to publication. All opinions, projections and estimates constitute the judgment of the author as of the date of the Product and
these, plus any other information contained in the Product, are subject to change without notice. Prices and availability of financial instruments also are
subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding other departments within the Firm advising the companies discussed in this Product, information obtained
in such role is not used in the preparation of the Product. Although Citi Research does not set a predetermined frequency for publication, if the Product is a
fundamental equity or credit research report, it is the intention of Citi Research to provide research coverage of the covered issuers, including in response to
news affecting the issuer. For non-fundamental research reports, Citi Research may not provide regular updates to the views, recommendations and facts
included in the reports. Notwithstanding that Citi Research maintains coverage on, makes recommendations concerning or discusses issuers, Citi Research
may be periodically restricted from referencing certain issuers due to legal or policy reasons. Citi Research may provide different research products and
services to different classes of customers (for example, based upon long-term or short-term investment horizons) that may lead to differing conclusions or
recommendations that could impact the price of a security contrary to the recommendations in the alternative research product, provided that each is
